# IndoorTrajectoryData

In this project, we introduce an indoor crowd trajectory benchmark dataset, called ICMTD-2019. The background of the dataset is set in a three-day large fictitious international cyber security academic conference, which is well-referenced to academic conferences in the real-world. The conference comprises varied academic and social activities, such as academic seminars, business exhibitions, a hacking contest, interviews, tea breaks, and a banquet. This dataset captures the movements of over 5000 participants in a two-story indoor conference venue collected by smart badges worn by them. The participants are divided into seven types according to participation permissions to activities. Moreover, some of the participants are involved in anomalous events, such as loss of items, unauthorized accesses, and equipment failures, forming a variety of spatial–temporal movement patterns. Some of these events involve fine-grained spatial–temporal patterns and complex correlations. The dataset was used in ChinaVis Data Challenge 2019, with a total of 75 entries submitted by 359 contestants. Feedback from the contestants showed that the ICMTD-2019 dataset can effectively identify the performance of methods, techniques and systems for indoor crowd trajectory analysis.
